# exercise: Let's Practice Using Data in Express!

## Welcome!

We are going to add to the API from our previous exercise to make requests using the 3 different types of data we can pass via a request: `req.params`, `req.query`, and `req.body`.

We will also learn to use an API-testing tool called [Postman](https://postman.co) (< click this), so that we do not need to have a frontend at all. Yay! ðŸ¥³

## Routes:

* GET `/` - App is listening
* GET `/pokemon` - Get all pokemon
* GET `/pokemon/:id` - Get pokemon by id
* GET `/search` - Get all matching pokemon
* POST `/pokemon` - Add a new pokemon


## Database

`pokemon.json` stores our data. While we will practice posting data, please note that we will not actually update this file from the API.

### Create a Server with Express

- [ ] Install the project's dependencies using `npm install`
- [ ] Start the server by running `index.js` using `npm run dev`.

## Server Setup

- Add the routes to fulfill the above list.
- You'll want your routes to just console.log data for now
  - Consider which route will use which of your 3 options of data sources:
    - `req.params`
    - `req.body`
    - `req.query`
- Import the data from `pokemon.json` so that you can use it in your file.

# Getting A Pokemon By ID `/pokemon/:id`

- Our first route will match `/pokemon/1` and return the JSON associated with just ONE pokemon.
- You will need to use your JavaScript fundamental skills to access the inner data and find what you need.
- Use Postman to test that this route indeed works and sends the response with the corresponding JSON.

# Viewing All Pokemon `/pokemon`

- Now you will flesh out your `/pokemon` route
- You want this to return the *entire* list of pokemon when someone makes a GET request.
- Be sure to use your testing tool to make the request and check the response.

# Make a New Pokemon `/pokemon`

- We'll need to add a middleware before we can read the JSON body from our request: `app.use(express.json())`
- Flesh out your `/pokemon` route for the POST request.
- You don't have a database, so you'll "pretend" to save the data for now.
  - Check to make sure the data from the client has the minimum requirements to make a new pokemon
    - If it does not:
      - Send a `422` status code to let the client know their data is not proper.
    - If it does...
      - Send a `204` status code letting the client know that the Pokemon was successfully made.


# Search Your Pokemon Data `/search`

- Now, it's time to flesh out your `/search` route.
- Searches are a great time to use query strings, instead of params or the body data.
- Make sure your route, sends a JSON response back to the client with all the pokemon that match their search query.
  - Note: This might be more than one -- consider your data structure wisely.
